## Personal Interests
- I really enjoy headbanging, even knowing I have no hair enough, but I just love to listen to metalcore, groovymetal, thrash metal and all Rock n' Roll stuff

- I love watching movies: thriller, horror, dramas and sci-fi are my favorite genres;
- I am Xbox player: Call me to play Dead by Daylight, I'm sure we can have fun together escaping from those villains
